<h1 class="topictitle1">XML editor</h1>




<div><p>The XML editor is a tool for creating and viewing XML files.</p>

<p>You can use it to perform a variety of tasks such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Creating new, empty XML files or generating them from existing DTDs or
existing XML schemas</li>

<li>Editing XML files</li>

<li>Importing existing XML files for structured viewing</li>

<li>Associating XML files with DTDs or XML schemas</li>

</ul>

<p>The XML editor has two main views - the Source view and the Design view.
You can also use the Outline view to insert and delete elements.</p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Source view</h4><p>The Source view enables you to view
and work directly with a file's source code. Many of the XML editing features
in the XML editor Source view are very similar to those available in the Source
view of Page Designer.</p>
<div class="p">The Source view has many text editing features,
such as: <ul>
<li> Syntax highlighting, unlimited undo/redo, and user-defined templates.</li>

<li> Content assist, which uses the information in a DTD or schema content
model to provide a list of acceptable continuations depending on where the
cursor is located in an XML file, or what has just been typed.</li>

<li>"Smart" double-clicking behavior. If your cursor is placed in an attribute
value, one double-click selects that value, another double click selects the
attribute-value pair, and a third double-click selects the entire tag. This
makes it easier to copy and paste commonly used pieces of XML.</li>

</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Design view</h4><div class="p">The XML editor also has a Design view.
This view has the following features:<ul>
<li>The XML file is represented simultaneously as a table and a tree. This
helps make navigation and editing easier.</li>

<li>Content and attribute values can be edited directly in the table cells,
while pop-up menus on the tree nodes give alternatives that are valid for
that location.  For example, the <span class="uicontrol">Add Child</span> menu item
will list only those elements from a DTD or XML schema which would be valid
children at that point (as long as grammar constraints are on).</li>

</ul>
</div>
<p>The Design view is especially helpful if you are new to XML, or
need to do form-oriented editing. For example, you could use the Create XML
File wizard to create a template XML file for a job description form from
a job description DTD. After those steps are completed, you would only have
to fill in the form data using the Design view.</p>
