 * This class provides consistent way to pre-check if a string is a valid XML

 * Attempting to create an Element with an invalid name will throw the appropriate
 * DOM Exception, but often clients want to check the validiting of a name
 * such as based on some user input, long in advance of actually making 
 * the DOM call. And, natually, want to give the user feedback in a more 
 * timely fashion.
 * 
 * ISSUE: is "endns:" really valid xml name? I think not, but this method
 * (currently) says it is.
