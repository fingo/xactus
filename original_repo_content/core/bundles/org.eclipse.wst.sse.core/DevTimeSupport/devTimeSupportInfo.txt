This directory, DevTimeSupport, normally contains
the source for some of our parser generators. 

See :pserver:dev.eclipse.org:/cvsroot/webtools/sourceediting/plugins/org.eclipse.wst.sse.core/DevTimeSupport

This particular text file you are reading 
is the only one shipped 
with an SDK build, since the other files 
are seldom needed during development or debugging, 
and some of those files cause problems with long 
filename or paths that end up being too long for 
some platforms, and some unzip programs.
