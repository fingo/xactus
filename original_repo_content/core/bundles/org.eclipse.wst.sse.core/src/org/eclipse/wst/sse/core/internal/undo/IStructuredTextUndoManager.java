	 * those algorithms and end one earlier than normal. The one known case is
	 * for multipage editors. If a user is on one page, and type '123' as
	 * attribute value, then click around to other parts of page, or different
	 * pages, then return to '123|' and type 456, then "undo" they typically
	 * expect the undo to just undo what they just typed, the 456, not the
	 * whole attribute value.

	 * If there is no pending command, the request is ignored.
