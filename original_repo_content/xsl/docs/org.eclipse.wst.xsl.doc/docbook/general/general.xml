      	XInclude allows a user to import or include other XML files into one xml file.
        It is used primarily with documentation file formats like Docbook and DITA.  It
        allows for separating out large xml documents into more manageable chunks of information.
      </para>
		<para>
      	The XSL Tools project includes an ANT task that can be run with in eclipse, eclipse
      	headless, and without eclipse at all.   If running outside of eclipse, you will need
      	to make sure that the jar file xinclude.jar in the org.eclipse.wst.xsl.core.jar file
      	is made avaiable on your class path.
