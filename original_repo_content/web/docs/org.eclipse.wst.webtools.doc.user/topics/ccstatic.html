<h1 class="topictitle1">Static Web projects</h1>


<div>
<p>If you  want to create a content-based Web application that does not contain
any dynamic content  (such as servlets, JSP files, filters, and associated
metadata) you might prefer to create a static Web project, as opposed to a <a href="ccwebprj.html" title="">dynamic Web project</a>.</p>

<div class="p">Static Web projects have the following characteristics:  <ul>
<li>a Web content folder (called WebContent) for all publishable resources,
You can change the name of this folder from the project's pop-up menu.</li>

<li>a Theme folder, the suggested directory for storing cascading style sheets
and other style-related objects.</li>

<li>the ability to define folders outside of the Web content folder, for storing
intermediate files, such as MIF files</li>

<li>a conversion path from a static Web project to a dynamic Web project.
If you decide to <a href="twpcnvrt.html" title="">convert</a> the
project, it will be a fully-valid dynamic Web project. </li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="p">In addition, your project will still have the following features (which
are common to both static and dynamic Web projects ) : <ul>
<li>HTML syntax validation</li>

<li>a broken link fix-up wizard</li>

<li>a Web site navigation tool</li>

<li>a new server type, the Static Web server, which makes it easy to publish
static Web projects</li>

</ul>
 </div>

<p>The folder that a static Web project is published to is modifiable, so
that when you set the publishing "root" value (called a <em>context root</em>),
such as <samp class="codeph">/web1</samp>, for a static project, everything in the Web
content folder will be published to the <span class="filepath">web1</span> folder under
the Web server's doc root. This enables you to group Web resources on a Web
server in folders that correspond to Web projects in the workbench. When projects
defined in this way are ready for production, you can publish specific projects
directly to the doc root by changing the value to <samp class="codeph">/</samp> and all
publishing, link fixing, and browsing will update automatically.</p>

<div class="p">Aliases can also be used to specify a context root value. For example,
suppose that there is an alias that is defined on the target Web server, as
follows: <pre>Alias /scripts/ "/var/www/scripts"</pre>
In this
example, in which the current static Web project will contain common JavaScriptâ„¢ files,
you can set the context root value to be <span>"scripts"</span>.  In order for
the resources in the static Web project to be published to the correct location
on the Web server, you must add this Alias mapping to the server tools instance
of the static Web server, as follows.  <ol>
<li>From the Server view, double-click on the static Web server configuration
to open the server configuration editor.<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> This assumes that you've already
defined the static Web server.</div>
</li>

<li>Click the <span class="uicontrol">Configuration</span> editor tab.</li>

<li>Scroll down to the <span class="uicontrol">Alias Path Mapping</span> section,
and add the new Alias mapping.</li>

</ol>
Now that <span>"scripts"</span> is defined as an Alias, the Web content in
the static Web project will be published to the mapped path, <span class="filepath">/var/www/scripts</span>.</div>
