	 * When an IValidator associates a target object with an IMessage, the
	 * WorkbenchReporter eventually resolves that target object with an
	 * IResource. Sometimes more than one target object resolves to the same
	 * IResource (usually the IProject, which is the default IResource when an
	 * IFile cannot be found). This method is called, by the
	 * WorkbenchReporter, so that the WorkbenchReporter can distinguish
	 * between the IMessages which are on the same IResource, but refer to
	 * different target objects. This is needed for the
	 * removeAllMessages(IValidator, Object) method, so that when one target
	 * object removes all of its messages, that it doesn't remove another
	 * target object's messages.
	 * 
	 * This method may return null only if object is null. Otherwise, an id
	 * which can uniquely identify a particular object must be returned. The
	 * id needs to be unique only within one particular IValidator.
