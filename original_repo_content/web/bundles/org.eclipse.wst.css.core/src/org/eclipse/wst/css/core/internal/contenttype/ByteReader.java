 * buffers are not controllable, and it sometimes pulls too much out of input
 * stream (even when it wasn't needed for our purposes).
 * 
 * The use of this class is highly specialized and by no means meant to be
 * general purpose. Its use is restricted to those cases where the input
 * stream can be regarded as ascii just long enough to determine what the real
 * encoding should be.
