These notes pertain to the v20041210_2300 version 
in CVS repository. 

Note, the "05-24" directory *should* match
the parser results from parser of same date, 
*but* after transition to org.eclipse, it seems 
the case of tags is different. Oddly, seems 
like the current treatement of case is correct, 
so ... 12-10 parser results should be used as 
reference, unless some new insight is gained. 
It does match previous version except for case. 
(And, the previous version was changed "by hand" 
to accomidate the transition to org.eclipse). 

TODO: this file, and 05-24 reference directory
can be deleted around M3, once whole team has 
reviewed and confident 12-10 version is correct
reference.
